## 1. The conditions of the Acceptance Criteria were satisfied
Read the Acceptance Criteria carefully. Make sure that your work completely satisfies the criteria. Do not do more than was asked. 

## 2. Examine your work
Before asking others to review your work, make sure that you examine it yourself. In case of code work, run the code and make sure that your improvement did not break any other features. Fatal errors and avoidable warnings are not permitted. 

## 3. All unit tests passed
 Similar to the point above, you will run all the unit tests before asking for a review. You may have to change a unit test to fit your improvement. 

## 4. Add new unit tests and/or test plans if necessary
If applicable, your improvement should contain new unit tests. The goal here is to test your logic and not the programming language or framework that is in use. In other words do not test a simple (1+1=2) equation. 

## 5. Have your work reviewed
Some other team member must review your code before itâ€™s merged with the main branch. Follow the rules of the [Source Control Guide](https://dev.azure.com/hhs-se-s6/Group%204/_wiki/wikis/Group-4.wiki/5/Source-Control-Guide) 

## 6. The UI is responsive
The UI should be fully functional on smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers.

## 7. The user has privacy by default
Don't take more data from the user than necessary. 

## 8. The code is secure by default
Make sure that unauthenticated and unauthorized people can not access things they should not have access to, especially user data.
